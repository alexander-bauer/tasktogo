.SH DESCRIPTION

.B tasktogo
is a task list manager built for interactive and scripting use. It is
capable of sorting and ranking tasks based on their priorities and due
dates, as well as adding and modifying dates.

If a command is given at invocation, it will be immediately executed,
exit. Otherwise
.B tasktogo
will enter a shell-like interactive mode for executing multiple
commands in sequence. Recognized commands are listed below, as are
flags, which can only be passed at initial invocation.
